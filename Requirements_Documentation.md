# Hostel Management System - Updated Requirements Document (v2.1)

## Project Overview
Create a comprehensive hostel management web application with attendance tracking as the primary module. The system should be scalable to accommodate additional features in future iterations.

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Java Spring Boot
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication
- **File Storage**: Local storage or cloud storage for student photos

## User Roles and Permissions

### 1. ADMIN
**Primary Responsibilities:**
- Populate and manage student form numbers in database
- Verify and approve student registration requests
- Designate and manage monitor roles
- Enter monthly total expenses
- View current balance and net balance of all students
- Process student payments and update balances
- Send student deletion requests to WARDEN
- Password reset functionality

### 2. WARDEN
**Primary Responsibilities:**
- Approve student deletion requests from ADMIN (permanent deletion)
- Approve absence requests submitted after 11 AM
- View monthly total expenses
- View current balance and net balance of all students
- Password reset functionality

### 3. STUDENT
**Primary Responsibilities:**
- Self-registration using form number
- Login and access personal dashboard
- Submit absence requests, default present
- View attendance history (last 3 months)
- View current balance, net balance, pending bills and monthly expenses
- Password reset functionality

### 4. MONITOR (Special Student Role)
**Additional Responsibilities:**
- Approve absence requests submitted before 11 AM
- Only one monitor can exist at a time (enforced by backend logic)
- Role can be transferred by ADMIN (backend atomically removes previous monitor)
- Monitor is tracked via `is_monitor` field in `students` table

## Detailed Functional Requirements

### Authentication & User Management

#### Student Registration Process
1. **Form Number Verification**
    - Student enters form number on registration page
    - System validates form number exists in pre-populated database
    - If invalid, display error message and prevent registration
    - If valid, proceed to registration form

2. **Registration Form Fields**
    - Email address (will be used for login)
    - Password (to be set by student)
    - Full university enrollment number
    - Full name
    - Phone number
    - Department
    - Batch/Year
    - Pin code
    - District
    - Tehsil
    - Guardian phone number
    - Student photograph upload

3. **Registration Verification of Students**
    - All registration requests require ADMIN approval
    - ADMIN can approve or reject requests
    - Only approved students can login to the system

#### Login System
- Students login using email and password
- JWT token-based authentication
- Session management and security
- Password reset functionality for all user types

### Attendance Management System

#### Default Attendance Status
- All students are marked present by default each day
- Students must actively request absence if needed

#### Absence Request Process
1. **Before 11:00 AM**
    - Students can submit absence requests
    - MONITOR approves/rejects these requests
    - Immediate processing required

2. **After 11:00 AM**
    - Students can still submit absence requests
    - Only WARDEN can approve these requests

#### Attendance History
- Students can view their attendance for the last 3 months
- Display in calendar or list format
- Show present/absent status for each day
- Include reasons for absence if provided

### Financial Management

#### Expense Calculation System
1. **Monthly Expense Entry**
    - ADMIN enters total monthly expenses for the hostel
    - System calculates per-day expense rate
    - Individual bills calculated based on days present

2. **Bill Generation Formula**
   ```
   Student Monthly Bill = (Total Monthly Expenses / Sum of total number of days students are present in the Month) Ã— Days Present of that student
   ```

3. **Payment Processing**
    - ADMIN records payments received and updates student balances
    - Support for partial, full, and advance payments
    - Maintain payment history and outstanding balance/advance balance
    - Generate payment receipts

4. **Balance Management**
    - Each student has a `current_balance` field tracking available funds
    - System calculates `netBalance` = current_balance - pending dues
    - `netBalance` indicates:
        - Positive value: Student has advance payment
        - Negative value: Student owes money
    - Balance information displayed on all relevant dashboards
    - **Net balance is calculated on-the-fly** and accessed through the student dashboard endpoint

#### Financial Dashboard
- Students view:
    - Current balance
    - Net balance (current balance - pending dues)
    - Pending bills
    - Monthly expenses
- ADMIN and WARDEN view:
    - Overall financial reports
    - Student balance summaries
    - Payment tracking and history

### Administrative Functions

#### Student Management
1. **Form Number Population**
    - ADMIN populates database with valid form numbers
    - Bulk import functionality
    - Edit/delete form numbers as needed

2. **Monitor Management**
    - ADMIN designates one student as monitor
    - When new monitor is set, previous monitor role is automatically removed
    - Only one monitor can exist at any time
    - Monitor retains all student privileges plus approval rights

3. **Student Deletion Process**
    - ADMIN initiates student deletion request
    - WARDEN must approve deletion requests
    - **Permanent deletion**: Student and all related data removed from database
    - Backend handles cascading deletion of related records


## UI/UX Requirements

### Design Principles
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach
- **Clean Interface**: Minimalist design with clear navigation
